## Overview

This operation is performed by:

1. The Node.js server that renders the initial React.js application. This is not necessarily the same server as your API, but it may be depending on your setup.
1. React Native applications upon opening the application.
1. React web applications following successful OAuth authentication.

## Request

##### method
###### GET

### Request Body

None. The API doesn't care about the body of this request.

--

### Request Headers

##### access-token
###### string
The access token acts as a password for each request.

##### client

##### uid
###### string
The unique identifier for the current user.

#### Success Response Headers

##### client

The client token is used to identify device (browser client, phone, tablet, etc) of the current session. This allows us to maintain multiple concurrent sessions across devices / browsers.

##### expiry
###### integer
The time at which the token will expire.

##### uid
###### string
The unique identifier for the current user.
